Summary
~~~~~~~

Have you always wanted to write more python, but you feel lost in the syntax,
style and semantics? Well, Python hackers like to toss many phrases around to
describe the style of their code; “Pythonic” being one of the most popular. But
what does this really mean?

In a language that strongly enforces a formatting style on the programmer,
keeping it "pythonic" is only the tip of what makes python a wonderful, but
confusing language. See what all the fuss is about in this introduction to the
styles and nuances of the Python programming language and the tools you should
be using when writing it.



A Poor Introduction to Buddhism and Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:The Four Noble Truths:

    1. Suffering does exist
       .. A good photo of an angry or frustrated programmer

       * We all deal with pain when programming. 
       * Choices we make when designing our environments for programming will
         characterize this pain, but not eliminate it.

    2. Suffering arises from attachment to desires

       * We want to build complex systems because it is thought that complexity
         is a virtue.
       * We desire to control computers with perfection.
       * We desire to get tasks done faster with less mistakes.

    3. Suffering ceases when attachment to desire ceases

       * Give up the notion that complexity is required for good functionality.
       * Use the tools that make your life as simple as possible.
       * Always choose a language that speaks to you, not what seems popular.

    4. Freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the `Eightfold Path`_

       * There is always a solution. Through careful practice we can overcome
         most obstacles. 
       * When programming, having constraints can assist because
         we are forced to be thoughtful and cautious.


.. _`Eightfold Path`: http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/eightfoldpath.html

:The Eightfold Path:

    1. Right understanding

       * Accept that programming is suffering and that with the right thoughts
         and actions we can arrive at a complete understanding of the true
         nature of programming.

    2. Right intention
    
       * With commitment to self-improvement we can achieve our goals through
         good intentions and the avoidance of desire.
       * By retaining our regimentation and strictness we can attain all.
    
    3. Right speech	

       * Abstain from false speech or lies
       * Do not be slanderous
       * Do not offend
       * Avoid idle chat

    4. Right action	
    5. Right livelihood	
    6. Right effort	
    7. Right mindfulness	
    8. Right concentration


The Tradition of Zen Buddhist Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zen emphasizes experiential Wisdom in the attainment of enlightenment. As such,
it de-emphasizes theoretical knowledge in favor of direct self-realization
through meditation and dharma practice.

:Zazen: sitting meditation, is the core of Zen Practice

  * Most programmers spend their days seated at a computer thinking.
  * This thought practice emphasises introspection into work products

* Koan Practice is a story or dialog, typically an anecdote

  * a famous programmer telling a story

* Chanting is a traditional means of preparing the mind for meditation

  * scrum meeting or something?


Time for PEP8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Define, the standard style guide for Python.
* Go over the big No No's. 
* Point out that it is not always followed, but it really should be .
* Show benefits of heavily considering the readability of your code.
* Poor readability should be considered a bug.


Knowing and Using the Standard Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python standard library is an enormous code base. Most basic program needs
are covered in the <number> modules that comprise the library. If you can think
of it, its probably in there to some extent. 

Now, a few good examples of what makes it so cool.

Then talk about Hellmann's MotW blog. Point out how easy the docs are the read
and navigate.
